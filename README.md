# To-Do-App_Node.js
Don't Forget is a to-do webapp that I developed for my internship project at hasura.
This internship was offered to me as a part of IMAD course held by NPTEL.

This webapp remembers all the tasks you feed into it and lets you see tasks that you have already finished.
Tasks can be searched by tags they are assigned.

Technologies used in frontend : HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT AND AJAX.
Technology used at backend: NODE.JS, POSTGRES DBMS AND API SERVICES PROVIDED BY HASURA.

The XMLHTTPRequest are to the WEB APIs provided by hasura middleware, so to run the project hasura has to be setup and deployed locally
or
email me @ satyam010singh@gmail.com to make project online over the internet from my machine.
